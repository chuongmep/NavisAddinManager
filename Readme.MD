## Summary

![AddinManager](pic/Addin.png)

Usually, when developing and debugging an add-in with [Navisworks](https://www.autodesk.com/products/navisworks/overview) API, user has to close & re-open [Navisworks](https://www.autodesk.com/products/navisworks/overview) each time
he/she modifies the add-in code and wants to re-compile. But with **Add-In Manager**, user can modify and run the Addin.
directly without closing & re-opening [Navisworks](https://www.autodesk.com/products/navisworks/overview) again and again.This tool enables users to test plugin code within Navisworks without having to create an entire plugin first.This is a next branch from [Revit Addin Manager](https://github.com/chuongmep/RevitAddInManager)
to support multiple platform API for developer. With current technology, you can use [Hot Reload](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/hot-reload?view=vs-2022) to speed it up.But try this project it will be faster with any Addin.
